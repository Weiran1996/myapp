  <h2>Internships</h2>
</body>
<h4><em>Kionix, Ithaca, NY, Software Engineer
</em></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Built an application to classify the surface for the vacuum cleaner with Kionix accelerometer</li>
  <li>Collected accel data and developed filtering, smoothing, cleansing, feature extraction algorithms</li>
  <li>Developed random forest model to classify surfaces as carpet, tile, rubber, wood in real time with
    accuracy over 91% and chosen to be the demo project for Sensors Expo 2019 in San Jose</li>
  <li>Designed and built a generic classifier training web wrapping all the data preprocessing, feature
    extraction and model training processes to a user-friendly GUI with highly configurable parameters</li>
  <li>Deployed backend server with Node.js, Express.js and cloud MongoDB; designed web UI using React</li>
</ul>
<h4><em>QiMing Tech, Changchun, Software Engineer
</em></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Led a team of three to collect speech data and develop multilingual speech recognition algorithm</li>
  <li>Converted 19GB collected multilingual speech data from .wav audio files to spectrogram data</li>
  <li>Developed Naive Bayes speech recognition algorithm from scratch in Python and trained the model
    with 3500 spectrograms of 200 most commonly used English words and Chinese words</li>
  <li>Achieved to improve the accuracy of speech recognition from 60% to 88.7% by removing silent
    segments using Voice Activity Detection from webrtcvad package</li>
</ul>
